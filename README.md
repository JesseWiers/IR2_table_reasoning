# IR2_table_reasoning

TAPEX pre-trains a model for table-based reasoning by simulating a neural SQL executor. Instead of relying on traditional NLP methods, TAPEX trains on SQL-like tasks over tables to improve structured data understanding, enabling it to handle question-answering and fact verification directly on tabular data. Evaluated on datasets like WikiSQL and TabFact, TAPEX demonstrates strong performance on table-centric tasks without needing SQL execution, using sequence generation to produce answers from table context alone.
